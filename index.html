    <h1>wanna play a game?</h1>
    <h2>so, what's all this then?</h2>
    <p>We've been pretty hush hush about our venue, mainly because I didn't want people to hear the options
      we were thinking of (or not thinking of) and have any expectations or opinions once we did finally decide.
      I know, I know, it's our day, but I just get all in my head. Anyways, soon it became a whole thing of people trying
      to figure it out and trying to get us to slip up.</p>

<p> Well, now's your chance to try.</p>



    <h3 class="mobile">
      Unfortunately, this doesn't play the best on mobile or tablets. You can still play, and most definitely solve the puzzles, but a desktop/laptop might provide a more helpful experience...</h3>
    <h3 class="mobile">
      If you are on a desktop/laptop and are seeing this, it's just probably the size of your window. Go ahead and make it bigger.
<!-- ok not a hint, but if you want to try something a little harder, but could be faster depending on how good you are, check out https://jochard2025.github.io/well/well/well.html -->
    </h3>

    <p >
      Riddles/puzzles that will lead to clues about our venue will appear here periodically (maybe once a week??). You probably won't get it with one, so the more you solve, the more clues you'll have. Some will definitely be easier than others, and some will be better clues than others.
</p>

    <p >
      Think of it like an escape room.
</p>

    <p >
      The goal is to have our invites be sent out (and thus revealing the answer) in time with the last clue.
</p>



<p >
<a class="link" href="https://jochard2025.github.io/page2.html" target="_blank">Ready?</a>
</p>

<p >
Or read on for more of my ramblings lol.
</p>

<h2 >how will it work?</h2>
<p >Puzzles/riddles/that-sort-of-vibe will be posted periodically. Each puzzle's answer is a clue to the venue. Use those clues (aka answers to those puzzles) to help you figure out the venue.</p>

<p >The answers will always be one word or numbers.</p>

	  
<h2 >what's in it for me</h2>
<p >Nothing lol. Bragging rights? I'll set-up a leader board.
<br />Some puzzles and riddles to solve, if that's your thing.
<br />Something to pass the time?</p>
<p >There is literally no obligation to play. You can just wait for the invites to come and find out then. Maybe you don't even care, that's cool too. I just love games and escape rooms and have too much time on my hands lol.</p>
</p>


<h4 >Is my answer right?</h4>
<p class="faq">You can check your answers (aka the venue clues) to each puzzle/riddle <a class="link" href="https://forms.gle/bj4N78ewfBmzk2Bo6" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
	For the final final answer (aka you put all the clues together and have found the venue) contact me, I'll let you know.</p>

<h4 >Can you give me a hint?</h4>
<p class="faq">lol no. <span class="desktop"><span style="color:white;">But if you look hard enough, you might find some</span>.</span></p>

<h4 >Can I work with others?</h4>
<p class="faq">Go for it, I'm not your teacher.</p>

<h4 >Do you also have time on your hands? Want more of this kinda stuff?</h4>
<p class="faq">This format and its puzzles are very much inspired by web games like <a class="link" href="https://ebonyriddle.com/" target="_blank">E.B.O.N.Y</a>.</p>

<p >Thanks to Jonella for giving us the idea of giving clues/puzzles to have people figure out our venue.</p>
