    <h2>look at you, so observant. or maybe just lucky? I'd keep this page on the dl</h2>
    <h3>what's all this then?</h3>
    <p>We've been pretty hush hush about our venue, mainly because I didn't want people to hear the options
      we were thinking of (or not thinking of) and have any expectations or opinions once we did finally decide.
      I know, I know, it's our day, but I just get all in my head. Anyways, soon it became a whole thing of people trying
      to figure it out and trying to get us to slip up. Well, now's your chance to try.</p>
    <h3 class="mobile">
      Unfortunately, this doesn't play well (or at all) on mobile or tablets. You're gonna need to be re<em>source</em>ful so get on a laptop/desktop.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="mobile">
      If you are on a desktop/laptop and are seeing this, it's just probably the size of your window. That shouldn't be an issue though, so just ignore this.
