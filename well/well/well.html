    <h2>look at you, so observant. or maybe just lucky? I'd keep this page on the dl</h2>
    <p>We've been pretty hush hush about our venue, mainly because I didn't want people to hear the options
      we were thinking of (or not thinking of) and have any expectations or opinions once we did finally decide.
      I know, I know, it's our day, but I just get all in my head. Anyways, soon it became a whole thing of people trying
      to figure it out and trying to get us to slip up. Well, now's your chance to try.</p>

      Unfortunately, this doesn't play well (or at all) on mobile or tablets. You're gonna need to be reSOURCEful so get on a desktop.
